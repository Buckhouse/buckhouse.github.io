			<b>Story</b>
			<br><br>
			<span class="firstcharacter">W</span>ith over a decade of filmmaking experience creating the cinematography and choreography for Shrek and Madagascar and other DreamWorks properties, James tells effective stories through shot construction, lens choice, staging, compositional emphasis, costume, lighting, dialog, and gesture. <br>
			<b>Design</b>
			<br><br>
He designed costumes, wrote jokes, created gags, helped develop character arcs, and worked out the specific staging, set dressing and shot construction at the shot, sequence, and film level.
<br><br>
<b>Pipeline</b>
<br><br>
Outside of his normal duties, James created a new streamlined pipeline for 2D/3D art. The innovations saved hours of tedious set-up labor, and resulted in character and costume designs that were cheaper to create and a more accurate match with the final 3D output.
<br><br>
As a designer he created some of the best costumes in the Shrek world – including a “medieval Dr. Zhivago” look for Princess Fiona for the Shrek Christmas special and a “wrap-dress” out of a wedding tent for the 50ft woman in Monsters vs. Aliens.
