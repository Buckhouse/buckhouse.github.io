Reds can vary in shade from very light pink to very dark maroon or burgundy; and in hue from the bright orange-red scarlet or vermilion to the bluish-red crimson. Red was widely used in prehistoric cave art, made with red hematite or iron oxide, or red ochre.

<p class="b-filter">Cyan is a greenish-blue color and is one of the three primary colors of the subtractive CMYK color model. On the color wheels of the RGB and CMYK color models.

It is located midway between blue and green, making it the complementary color of red. Its name is derived from Ancient Greek, transliterated, meaning "dark blue". It was formerly known as "cyan blue" or cyan-blue and its first recorded use of as a color name in English was in 1879. Further origins of the color name can be traced back to a dye produced from the cornflower (Centaurea cyanus). The web color cyan is synonymous with aqua. In most languages, cyan is not a basic color term and it phenomenologically appears as a greenish vibrant hue of blue to most English speakers. Reasons for why cyan is not linguistically acknowledged as a basic color term can be found in the frequent lack of distinction between blue and green in many languages. Some varieties in the cyan color range are teal, turquoise, electric blue, aquamarine, and other colors described as blue-green.</p>
