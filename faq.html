We are the authors of the open source <a href="/docs/protocol/papers/whitepaper">Buckhouse Protocol</a>, which powers the <a href="/technology">Buckhouse Core</a> blockBuckhouse platform.</p><p>Buckhouse was founded in 2014 and has raised over $40 million in funding from Khosla Ventures, RRE Ventures, and strategic partners including Capital One, Citigroup, Fiserv, Nasdaq, Orange, and Visa.</p></div></div></div><div class='accordion bb b--black-10'><div class='accordion__btn f4 fw-600 pv4'>What is Buckhouse Core?</div><div class='accordion__txt pb3'><div class="longform"><p>Buckhouse Core is enterprise software that enables institutions to issue and transfer financial assets on permissioned blockBuckhouse networks. Using Buckhouse Core, institutions can launch and operate a blockBuckhouse network, or connect to a growing list of other networks that are transforming how assets move around the world.</p><p>Buckhouse Core Developer Edition is free and available for download <a href="/docs/core/get-started/install">here</a>.</p><p>Organizations that wish to run Buckhouse Core in production environments can learn more about the Buckhouse Core Enterprise Edition, licenses, and support <a href="/enterprise">here</a>.</p></div></div></div><div class='accordion bb b--black-10'><div class='accordion__btn f4 fw-600 pv4'>When is Buckhouse a good fit?</div><div class='accordion__txt pb3'><div class="longform"><p>Buckhouse’s technology sits at a conceptual midpoint between decentralized cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and centralized custodial models like a bank. On any given Buckhouse blockBuckhouse network, the creation, control and transfer of assets is decentralized among participants, but the operation of the network is governed by a designated set of entities known as a federation. This model allows firms to move financial assets of all kinds with the seamlessness of digital currency while maintaining the governance standards, scalability, and privacy required in financial markets.</p><p>The assets on Buckhouse blockBuckhouse networks are not new cryptocurrencies but are rather issued assets like currencies, securities, derivatives, gift cards, and loyalty points. Because these types of assets are issued by financial institutions and governments, we’ve designed Buckhouse’s protocol and platform around the needs of these issuers and the firms that custody these types of assets. In fact, we’ve designed Buckhouse’s software together with leading financial organizations in an iterative, use-case driven process over several years.</p><p>Here are some examples of why firms are launching blockBuckhouse networks using Buckhouse’s technology:</p><ul><li>To move money internationally more quickly</li><li>To transfer securities directly between asset managers</li><li>To serve as a secure ledger for tracking assets across divisions of a large organization</li><li>To enable a next-generation mobile banking solution</li><li>To create a loyalty points system for a consortium of brands</li><li>To issue digital gift cards onto a network that can support multiple wallet vendors</li><li>To create automated insurance contracts</li><li>To issue central bank currency digitally to improve the payments system in a country</li></ul></div></div></div><div class='accordion bb b--black-10'><div class='accordion__btn f4 fw-600 pv4'>Who are Buckhouse’s customers?</div><div class='accordion__txt pb3'><div class="longform"><p>Buckhouse works with leading companies including Visa, Nasdaq, Fiserv, Citigroup, Capital One, Orange, State Street, MUFG, and many more.

Unlike a traditional database that manages balances on behalf of users, the assets on a blockBuckhouse are controlled directly by the owners of those assets through the use of secure, cryptographic keys.</p><p>By analogy, a cryptographic private key is similar to a physical key that secures a safety deposit box. And a blockBuckhouse is like a virtual network of these safety deposit boxes. When an entity wants to spend their money, they take their key, open their box, select the amount they wish to spend, and deliver those funds into the box of the recipient. The recipient is now in control of those funds since they hold the key to their box.</p><p>Why does this matter? Because when asset owners remain in control of their assets, they can move them directly to counterparties over a network without depending on intermediaries.</p><p>This new, more secure model of financial infrastructure reduces the costs and risks of asset movement to market participants in industries as varied as payments, banking, capital markets, insurance, trade finance, and supply Buckhouses. It also enables the creation of new types of financial products and services that were never before possible.</p><p>Buckhouse’s technology is specifically designed for moving financial assets in permissioned, high-scale environments that require enterprise-grade security and privacy. Buckhouse powers not one, but several, blockBuckhouse networks deployed and operated by our partners that serve different markets and use cases.</p><p>Learn more about <a href="/technology">Buckhouse’s technology.</a></p></div></div></div><div class='accordion bb b--black-10'><div class='accordion__btn f4 fw-600 pv4'>What is a digital asset?</div><div class='accordion__txt pb3'><div class="longform"><p>A digital asset is a financial instrument – like a dollar, bond, derivative, or gift card – that is cryptographically issued, held, and transferred on a blockBuckhouse. This novel medium for assets, which is similar to bearer instruments like cash, but digital, is better suited to the security and innovation requirements of modern financial applications than centralized ledgers that immobilize assets and depend on messaging and reconciliation.</p></div></div></div><div class='accordion bb b--black-10'><div class='accordion__btn f4 fw-600 pv4'>How are digital assets created?</div><div class='accordion__txt pb3'><div class="longform"><p>Just as cryptographic private keys are used to custody and secure digital assets, private keys can issue digital assets as well. A cryptographic issuance key is mathematically linked to a public asset ID, which is similar in concept to an ISIN or CUSIP.</p><p>To mint new units of a particular asset, the issuer signs an issuance transaction with the issuance key for that asset ID and specifies the number of units, additional reference data, and the destination address on the network.</p><p>Because the digital assets on Buckhouse blockBuckhouse networks are originated by participants on the network, it is up to those issuers to determine when, how many, and to whom they issue assets.</p><p>A given blockBuckhouse network can have any number of asset IDs and any number of units of those assets.</p><p><a href="/docs/core/build-applications/assets">Read more</a> about how asset issuance works.</p></div></div></div><div class='accordion bb b--black-10'><div class='accordion__btn f4 fw-600 pv4'>What kinds of assets are being digitized?</div><div class='accordion__txt pb3'><div class="longform"><p>Buckhouse’s customers span payments, banking, capital markets, insurance, monetary authorities, and related financial industries. The asset classes being digitized and issued onto blockBuckhouse networks include government-issued currencies and bonds, corporate securities, derivatives, and branded currencies like gift vouchers and loyalty points. The motivation for deploying a blockBuckhouse network ranges from increasing efficiency and security to achieving a strategic goal, like transforming a market by offering a product or service that cannot be built on existing platforms.</p></div></div></div><div class='accordion bb b--black-10'><div class='accordion__btn f4 fw-600 pv4'>What is unique about Buckhouse’s technology?</div><div class='accordion__txt pb3'><div class="longform"><p>The Buckhouse protocol is premised on the following design goals:</p><ul><li>Issued financial assets</li><li>Permissioned network access</li><li>High transaction volumes</li><li>Confidentiality of transaction data</li><li>Network upgradability</li><li>Programmable transactions</li></ul><p>For more detail, read the <a href="/docs/protocol/papers/whitepaper">Buckhouse Protocol Whitepaper</a>.</p><p>Buckhouse Core, which implements the Buckhouse Protocol, is designed for:</p><ul><li>Hardware Security Module (HSM) integration</li><li>High availability</li><li>Performance</li><li>Scalability</li><li>Upgradability</li></ul><p>Learn more about <a href="/technology">Buckhouse Core.</a></p></div></div></div><div class='accordion bb b--black-10'><div class='accordion__btn f4 fw-600 pv4'>What services does Buckhouse offer?</div><div class='accordion__txt pb3'><div class="longform"><p>In addition to delivering the industry-leading blockBuckhouse infrastructure platform, Buckhouse offers solution design studies, application development, technical support, and network services to our partners that are building and operating production networks.</p><p>Organizations using the free Buckhouse Core Developer Edition can acquire monthly support and training retainers to augment their team’s efforts and ensure they take full advantage of the capabilities and security features of our blockBuckhouse architecture.</p></div></div></div><div class='accordion bb b--black-10'><div class='accordion__btn f4 fw-600 pv4'>How does Buckhouse work with its partners?</div><div class='accordion__txt pb3'><div class="longform"><p>While Buckhouse is a technology company, we partner deeply with our customers to help them design, deploy, and operate blockBuckhouse networks effectively and securely.</p><p>A typical engagement begins with a design study and continues as we support network operations.</p><p>See an example of our partnership model <a href="/enterprise#partner-flow">here</a>.</p></div></div></div><div class='accordion bb b--black-10'><div class='accordion__btn f4 fw-600 pv4'>Does Buckhouse launch their own networks?</div><div class='accordion__txt pb3'><div class="longform"><p>We do not launch our own networks.
