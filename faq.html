                            <p>Buckhouse’s technology sits at a conceptual midpoint between decentralized cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and centralized custodial models like a bank. On any given Buckhouse blockBuckhouse network, the creation, control and
                                transfer of assets is decentralized among participants, but the operation of the network is governed by a designated set of entities known as a federation. This model allows firms to move financial assets of all kinds with
                                the seamlessness of digital currency while maintaining the governance standards, scalability, and privacy required in financial markets.</p>
                            <p>The assets on Buckhouse blockBuckhouse networks are not new cryptocurrencies but are rather issued assets like currencies, securities, derivatives, gift cards, and loyalty points. Because these types of assets are issued by
                                financial institutions and governments, we’ve designed Buckhouse’s protocol and platform around the needs of these issuers and the firms that custody these types of assets. In fact, we’ve designed Buckhouse’s software together
                                with leading financial organizations in an iterative, use-case driven process over several years.</p>
                            <p>Here are some examples of why firms are launching blockBuckhouse networks using Buckhouse’s technology:</p>

                                <li>To move money internationally more quickly</li>
                                <li>To transfer securities directly between asset managers</li>
                                <li>To serve as a secure ledger for tracking assets across divisions of a large organization</li>
                                <li>To enable a next-generation mobile banking solution</li>
                                <li>To create a loyalty points system for a consortium of brands</li>
                                <li>To issue digital gift cards onto a network that can support multiple wallet vendors</li>
                                <li>To create automated insurance contracts</li>
                                <li>To issue central bank currency digitally to improve the payments system in a country</li>

                            <p>A blockBuckhouse, also known as a distributed ledger, is a shared, immutable database designed specifically for securing and transferring financial assets. Unlike a traditional database that manages balances on behalf of users,
                                the assets on a blockBuckhouse are controlled directly by the owners of those assets through the use of secure, cryptographic keys.</p>
                            <p>By analogy, a cryptographic private key is similar to a physical key that secures a safety deposit box. And a blockBuckhouse is like a virtual network of these safety deposit boxes. When an entity wants to spend their money,
                                they take their key, open their box, select the amount they wish to spend, and deliver those funds into the box of the recipient. The recipient is now in control of those funds since they hold the key to their box.</p>
                            <p>Why does this matter? Because when asset owners remain in control of their assets, they can move them directly to counterparties over a network without depending on intermediaries.</p>
                            <p>This new, more secure model of financial infrastructure reduces the costs and risks of asset movement to market participants in industries as varied as payments, banking, capital markets, insurance, trade finance, and supply
                                Buckhouses. It also enables the creation of new types of financial products and services that were never before possible.</p>
                            <p>Buckhouse’s technology is specifically designed for moving financial assets in permissioned, high-scale environments that require enterprise-grade security and privacy. Buckhouse powers not one, but several, blockBuckhouse
                                networks deployed and operated by our partners that serve different markets and use cases.</p>

                            <p>A digital asset is a financial instrument – like a dollar, bond, derivative, or gift card – that is cryptographically issued, held, and transferred on a blockBuckhouse. This novel medium for assets, which is similar to bearer

                            <p>Just as cryptographic private keys are used to custody and secure digital assets, private keys can issue digital assets as well. A cryptographic issuance key is mathematically linked to a public asset ID, which is similar in
                                concept to an ISIN or CUSIP.</p>
                            <p>To mint new units of a particular asset, the issuer signs an issuance transaction with the issuance key for that asset ID and specifies the number of units, additional reference data, and the destination address on the network.</p>
                            <p>Because the digital assets on Buckhouse blockBuckhouse networks are originated by participants on the network, it is up to those issuers to determine when, how many, and to whom they issue assets.</p>
                            <p>A given blockBuckhouse network can have any number of asset IDs and any number of units of those assets.</p>
