                            <p>My father fell from a tree with a running chainsaw in his hand—the same chainsaw that years later my sister would use to accidently cut off the tip of his finger, which he re-grew, like a starfish, after soaking it in a pint of iodine—as he fell, he just caught a glimpse of me sitting beneath him and managed to throw the chainsaw in the other direction. The effort required to make the throw twisted his body so that now he was falling parallel to the ground with no way to right himself. He broke his ankle across the log upon which my sister and I sat. It made a percussive thump as it cracked. We retrieved the bent saw. My mother drove to the hospital. No one was killed. </p>

                            <p>Across a million and a half acres of BLM land in the deserts of Eastern and Southern Oregon, I spent a week tracking wild mustangs with my father. Eventually we found a running bachelor who had lost a fight for dominance. Hidden in the folds of a hillside valley, we found the rest of the pack. For a few brief moments we got to film them up close. The results of that trip became the source material for a gallery show of paintings in LA. </p>

                            <p>I wrote a satirical novel about the world’s greatest bikini designer—exploring the existential struggles of four triangles held together with a piece of string. I cover some of the same territory as other books on art and poetics, but sneak it in with a laugh. The book was a part of a solo exhibition at the Berkeley Museum of Art. The NY Times wrote a flattering review of it where they graciously played along with just enough of a wink. </p>

                            <p>When writing jokes for Snoop Dogg, I’ve learned to write them straight, and to let him shizzlate. It is not my place to pre-shizzlate. When writing jokes for DreamWorks, it’s best to do it in groups of three or more—example: I wrote the the least funny 1/3 of the Mission-Impossible-Pinocchio-in-a-thong joke. Most of my jokes for DreamWorks were sight gags involving a prop, such as a medieval mechanical bull or an obscure cultural reference, such as Un Chien Andalou or Corsaire. When writing jokes for Investors, CEOs and tech executives, keep the words short.</p>
